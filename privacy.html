    <h1 id="jstorrent">JSTorrent Privacy Policy</h1>

      <pre>

    The following privacy policy refers to the JSTorrent and JSTorrent
    Lite applications published in the Chrome Web Store. Both
    applications offer the same functionality, JSTorrent Lite simply
    stops working after 20 downloads.

    JSTorrent does not collect any personally identifiable
    information. The application does not have access to your browsing
    activity.

    JSTorrent may transmit anonymous usage information about activity
    within the application. The data is transmitted securely to Google
    Analytics. The types of data transmitted include:

    - Tracking clicks within the app
    - Tracking statistics about completed downloads
    - Tracking file extensions and approximate file sizes
      of completed downloads
    - Tracking statistics of number of torrents completed or started
    - Tracking for unexpected runtime errors to help improve
      the application

    This data is not shared with any other parties. It is used for the
    sole purpose of tracking errors and improving the product.

    You can opt out of transmitting anonymous usage statistics by
    clicking on the "Settings" menu within the app and unchecking the
    box for "Report usage statistics"

    <b>Peer to Peer Activity, and Trackers</b>
    
    The nature of the BitTorrent protocol means that the application
    does make peer to peer connections with other hosts on the
    network.

    Each time you download a torrent, you will be sending the infohash
    of that torrent to other peers you connect to. You can see which
    peers and their IP addresses in the "Peers" tab within the
    application. The infohash uniquely identifies the torrent.

    In addition, you send the infohash of the torrent you download
    to a list of trackers. You can read more about how BitTorrent
    traffic sends information to trackers here:
    http://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0003.html

    If an added torrent does not include any trackers, or does not
    receive any peers from its trackers, it may automatically add a
    list of public trackers to that torrent. You can disable this
    option in the application's Settings.
